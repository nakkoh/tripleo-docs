Creating backups and restores using ReaR
----------------------------------------


ReaR is a disaster recovery solution for Linux.
Relax-and-Recover, creates both a bootable rescue
image and a backup of the associated files you choose.

When doing disaster recovery of a system, this Rescue
Image plays the files back from the backup and so in
very quickly to the latest state.

Various configuration options are available for the rescue
image. For example, slim ISO files, USB sticks or even images
for PXE servers are generated. As many backup options are
possible. Starting with a simple archive file (eg * .tar.gz),
various backup technologies such as IBM Tivoli Storage
Manager (TSM), EMC NetWorker (Legato), Bacula or even Bareos
can be addressed.

ReaR is written in Bash and it enables the skillful distribution
of Rescue Images and if necessary archive files via NFS, CIFS
(SMB) or another transport method in the network.
The actual recovery process then takes place via this transport
route.

In this specific case, due to the nature of the OpenStack deployment
we will choose those protocols that are allowed by default in the
Iptables rules (SSH, SFTP in particular).

We will apply this specific use of ReaR to recover
a failed control plane after a critical maintenance
task (like an upgrade).

1. Prepare the Undercloud backup bucket.

We need to prepare the place to store the backups from
the Overcloud. From the Undercloud, check you have enough
space to make the backups and prepare the environment.
We will also create a user in the Undercloud with no shell
access to be able to push the backups from the controllers
or the compute nodes::

  groupadd backup
  mkdir /data
  useradd -m -g backup -d /data/backup backup
  echo "backup:backup" | chpasswd
  chown -R backup:backup /data
  chmod -R 755 /data

2. Run the backup from the Overcloud nodes.

Let's install some required packages and run some previous
configuration steps::

  # Install packages
  sudo yum install rear genisoimage syslinux lftp wget -y

  # Make sure you are able to use sshfs to store the ReaR backup
  sudo yum install fuse -y
  sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools" -y
  wget http://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/f/fuse-sshfs-2.10-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
  sudo rpm -i fuse-sshfs-2.10-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

  sudo mkdir -p /data/backup
  sudo sshfs -o allow_other backup@undercloud-0:/data/backup /data/backup
  # Use backup password, which is... backup

Now, let's configure ReaR config file.::

  #Configure ReaR
  sudo tee -a "/etc/rear/local.conf" > /dev/null <<'EOF'
  OUTPUT=ISO
  OUTPUT_URL=sftp://backup:backup@undercloud-0/data/backup/
  BACKUP=NETFS
  BACKUP_URL=sshfs://backup@undercloud-0/data/backup/
  BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( --gzip )
  BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=".gz"
  BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/data/*' )
  EOF

Now run the backup, this should create an ISO image in
the Undercloud node (/data/backup/).

**You will be asked for the backup user password**::

  sudo rear -d -v mkbackup

Now, we can proceed to simulate a failure in any node we want
to restore for testing the procedure.::

  sudo rm -rf /lib

After the ISO image is created, we can proceed to
verify we can restore it from the Hypervisor.

3. Prepare the hypervisor.

We will run in the Hypervisor some pre backup steps in
order to have the correct configuration to mount the
backup bucket from the Undercloud node::

  # Enable the use of fusefs for the VMs on the hypervisor
  setsebool -P virt_use_fusefs 1

  # Install some required packages
  sudo yum install -y fuse-sshfs

  # Mount the Undercloud backup folder to access the images
  mkdir -p /data/backup
  sudo sshfs -o allow_other root@undercloud-0:/data/backup /data/backup
  ls /data/backup/*

4. Stop the damaged controller node.

In this step we will proceed to edit the VM definition
to be able to boot the rescue image.::

  virsh shutdown controller-0
  # virsh destroy controller-0

  # Wait until is down
  watch virsh list --all

  # Backup the guest definition
  virsh dumpxml controller-0 > controller-0.xml
  cp controller-0.xml controller-0.xml.bak

Now, we need to change the guest definition to boot from the ISO file.

Edit controller-0.xml and update it to boot from the ISO file.

Find the OS section,add the cdrom device and enable the boot menu.::

  <os>
  <boot dev='cdrom'/>
  <boot dev='hd'/>
  <bootmenu enable='yes'/>
  </os>

Edit the devices section and add the CDROM.::

  <disk type='file' device='cdrom'>
  <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
  <source file='/data/backup/rear-controller-0.iso'/>
  <target dev='hdc' bus='ide'/>
  <readonly/>
  <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='1' target='0' unit='0'/>
  </disk>

Update the guest definition.::

  virsh define controller-0.xml

Restart and connect to the guest::

  virsh start controller-0
  virsh console controller-0

You should be able to see the boot menu to start the recover
process, select Recover controller-0 and follow the instructions.

Now, before proceeding to run the controller restore, it's
possible that the host undercloud-0 can't be resolved,
just execute.::

  echo "192.168.24.1 undercloud-0" >> /etc/hosts

Having resolved the Undercloud host, we just need to follow the
wizard and wait to have the environment restored.

You should see a message like: ::

  Welcome to Relax-and-Recover. Run "rear recover" to restore your system !
  RESCUE controller-0:~ # rear recover

The image restore should progress quickly.

Now, each time you reboot the node will have the ISO file
as the first boot option so it's something we need to fix.
In the mean time let's check if the restore went fine.

Reboot the guest booting from the hard disk.

Now we can see that the guest VM started successfully.

Now we need to restore the guest to it's original definition,
so from the Hypervisor we need to restore the `controller-0.xml.bak`
file we created.::

  # From the Hypervisor
  virsh shutdown controller-0
  watch virsh list --all
  virsh define controller-0.xml.bak
  virsh start controller-0

Considerations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Space.
- Multiple protocols supported but we might then to update
  firewall rules, that's why we choose SFTP.
- Network load when moving data.
- Shutdown/Starting sequence for HA control plane.
- Do we need to backup the data plane?
- User workloads should be handled by a third party backup software.
