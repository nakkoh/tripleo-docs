Ansible config-download differences
===================================
With the Queens release, it became possible to use Ansible to apply the
overcloud configuration and this method became the default behavior with
the Rocky release.

The feature is fully documented at
:doc:`ansible_config_download`, while this page details
the differences to the deployer experience with config-download.

Ansible vs. os-collect-config
-----------------------------
Previously, TripleO used an agent running on each overcloud node called
``os-collect-config``. This agent periodically polled the undercloud Heat API for
software configuration changes that needed to be applied to the node.

``os-collect-config`` ran ``os-refresh-config`` and ``os-apply-config`` as
needed whenever new software configuration changes were detected. This model
is a **"pull"** style model given each node polled the Heat API and pulled changes,
then applied them locally.

With config-download, TripleO has switched to a **"push"** style model. Ansible
is run from a central control node which is the undercloud.
``ansible-playbook`` is run from the undercloud and software configuration
changes are pushed out to each overcloud node via ssh.

With the new model, ``os-collect-config``, ``os-refresh-config``, and
``os-apply-config`` are no longer used in a TripleO deployment. The
``os-collect-config`` service is now disabled by default and won't start on
boot.

.. note::

    Heat standalone software deployments still rely on ``os-collect-config``.
    They are a type of deployment that can be applied to overcloud nodes
    directly via Heat outside of the overcloud stack, and without having to do
    a full stack update of the overcloud stack.

    These types of deployments are **NOT** typically used when doing TripleO.

    However, if these deployments are being used in an environment to manage
    overcloud nodes, then the ``os-collect-config`` service must be started and
    enabled on the overcloud nodes where these types of deployments are
    applied.

    For reference, the Heat CLI commands that are used to create these types of
    deployments are::

        openstack software config create ...
        openstack software deployment create ...

    If these commands are not being used in the environment, then
    ``os-collect-config`` can be left disabled.

Deployment workflow
-------------------
The default workflow executed by ``openstack overcloud deploy`` takes care of
all the necessary changes when using config-download. In both the previous and
new workflows, ``openstack overcloud deploy`` (tripleoclient) takes care of
automating all the steps through Mistral workflow(s). Therefore, existing CLI
scripts that called ``openstack overcloud deploy`` will continue to work with
no changes.

It's important to recognize the differences in the workflow to aid in
understanding the deployment and operator experience. Previously, Heat was
responsible for:

#. (Heat) Creating OpenStack resources (Neutron networks, Nova/Ironic instances, etc)
#. (Heat) Creating software configuration
#. (Heat) Applying the created software configuration to the Nova/Ironic instances

With config-download, Heat is no longer responsible for the last item of
applying the created software configuration as ``ansible-playbook`` is used
instead.

Therefore, only creating the Heat stack for an overcloud is no longer all that
is required to fully deploy the overcloud. Ansible also must be run from the
undercloud to apply the software configuration, and do all the required tasks
to fully deploy an overcloud such as configuring services, bootstrap tasks, and
starting containers.

The new steps are summarized as:

#. (Heat) Creating OpenStack resources (Neutron networks, Nova/Ironic instances, etc)
#. (Heat) Creating software configuration
#. (tripleoclient) Enable tripleo-admin ssh user
#. (ansible) Applying the created software configuration to the Nova/Ironic instances

See :doc:`ansible_config_download` for details on the
tripleo-admin ssh user step.

Deployment CLI output
---------------------
During a deployment, the expected output from ``openstack overcloud deploy``
has changed. Output up to and including the stack create/update is similar to
previous releases. Stack events will be shown until the stack operation is
complete.

After the stack goes to ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` (or ``UPDATE_COMPLETE``), output
from the steps to enable the tripleo-admin user via ssh are shown.

config-download Use Cases
-------------------------
config-download exposes the ability to manually run the ``ansible-playbook``
command against the playbooks that are generated for the deployment. This leads
to many advantages over the older Heat deployment model.

-  Test deployments. Using the
   ``ansible-playbook --check --diff deploy_steps_playbook.yaml``
   arguments will not modify an existing deployment. Instead, it will only show
   any changes that would be made.
-  Development environment testing. Ansible variables can be modified to do
   quick testing. Once verified, Heat environment templates need to be updated
   to reflect the change permanently. Then the config-download content should
   be re-generated by running ``openstack overcloud deploy --stack-only``.
-  Run specific tasks. It is possible to run certain parts of a deployment by
   using ``--tags``.
-  Prepare the deployment or update ahead of time and then run the playbooks
   later. The operations around a deployment can be done at different times to
   minimize risk.
-  Integration with CI/CD. Additional checks and verification can be added to
   a CI/CD pipeline relating to updating Heat templates and the Ansible
   config-download content.
-  AWX or Ansible Tower integration. Ansible content can be imported and ran
   through a scalable and distributed system.
